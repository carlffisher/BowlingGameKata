Neil, another mishtake.

I realise now that my approach is totally wrong, for this Kata and also the previous one, although the solution works (more or less).

In trying to understand the 'rules' for each exercise I focussed on process and ended up writing C style solutions for both Katas. 
Then I ran out of time.

Now I realise that designing and creating the objects will allow the solution to emerge incrementally.

Oh, dear!
